<p> I'm sure almost everybody can say that they enjoy reading it's always fun to dive into you favourite book after a while. Reading is very fun and thats why I like it there's always going to be some plot twist or sad moment or an "Element of Suprise" but either way reading is one of my favourite hobbies. </p>
